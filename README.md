# THE MET landing page

- [DEMO LINK](https://github.com/mykhailonl/THE-MET-landing/)

Hey there! Take a peek at my latest project â€“ a landing page inspired by The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met). As part of my web development practice, I've put together this landing page for my portfolio showcase.

The landing page is a rendition of what the museum's website homepage might look like, complete with a header, side menu, various content sections, and a feedback form. It's built using HTML and SCSS, giving it a structured layout and style.

One of the neat features of this project is its full responsiveness, meaning it seamlessly adapts to various devices like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. So whether you're browsing on the go or chilling at home, you'll have a smooth experience.

I'm really stoked about how this project turned out. It's not about designing from scratch but more about implementing an existing design in a functional and user-friendly way. Can't wait to hear your thoughts!
